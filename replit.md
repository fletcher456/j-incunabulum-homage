# J Language Interpreter Project

## Overview
Rust-based web server with J language interpreter implementing array programming language features. Started as C webserver, evolved to full J interpreter with calculator interface and WASM deployment capability.

## Recent Changes
- **Jun 23, 2025**: Successfully completed Phase 2 - Added monadic operations (~, -) with precedence framework
- **Jun 23, 2025**: Verified Phase 2 functionality: "~3", "1+~3", "~3+1", "~3+~3" all working correctly
- **Jun 23, 2025**: Confirmed proper precedence handling: monadic operations bind tighter than dyadic
- **Jun 23, 2025**: Created comprehensive WASM deployment strategy - complete 4.5 hour roadmap for client-side evaluation
- **Jun 23, 2025**: Completed UI cleanup - removed radio buttons and internal parser indicators for cleaner user interface
- **Jun 23, 2025**: Successfully completed LALRPOP removal - eliminated all dependencies and achieved WASM readiness
- **Jun 23, 2025**: Successfully completed Phase 5 - Parentheses support with full feature parity achieved
- **Jun 23, 2025**: Created comprehensive LALRPOP removal strategy - systematic 3.5 hour implementation plan
- **Jun 23, 2025**: Created reorganized strategy document focusing on immediate phases (Array Literals, J Operators, Parentheses)
- **Jun 23, 2025**: Successfully completed Phase 1 - Custom parser with literals and basic addition

## Project Architecture

### Core Components
- **Tokenizer** (`tokenizer.rs`): Lexical analysis for J expressions
- **LALRPOP Parser** (`j_grammar.lalrpop`): Grammar-based parsing with precedence
- **Semantic Analyzer** (`semantic_analyzer.rs`): Context resolution for ambiguous operators
- **Evaluator** (`evaluator.rs`): Expression evaluation with array operations
- **J Array System** (`j_array.rs`): Multi-dimensional array data structures
- **Web Interface** (`j_repl.html`): Calculator-style input with matrix display

### WASM Integration
- **Hybrid Compilation**: LALRPOP generates parser natively, compiles to WASM
- **HTTP Adapter**: Minimal layer intercepting `/j_eval` requests for WASM
- **Graceful Fallback**: Automatic server fallback when WASM unavailable
- **Zero Breaking Changes**: Existing functionality preserved entirely

### Supported Operations
- Basic arithmetic: `+`, `-`, `*`, `%` (with monadic/dyadic forms)
- Array operations: reshape `#`, indexing `{`, concatenation `,`, boxing `<`
- Advanced features: Multi-dimensional arrays, vector operations, compound expressions

## Implementation Status
- âœ… Core J interpreter with all major operators
- âœ… Web interface with calculator buttons and matrix formatting
- âœ… LALRPOP parser integration with proper precedence
- âœ… Multi-dimensional array support with enhanced data structures
- âœ… WASM adapter architecture with fallback system
- âœ… Hybrid WASM compilation approach (LALRPOP native, execution WASM)
- âœ… Phase 0: Custom parser stub with parser selection UI working
- âœ… Phase 1: Custom parser supporting literals and addition operations (fully functional)
- âœ… Phase 2: Monadic operations (~, -) with precedence framework (fully functional)
- âœ… Phase 3: Array literals - multi-element vectors and vector operations (fully functional)
- âœ… Phase 4: J Array Operators - #, {, ,, < with monadic/dyadic support and AST consistency (fully functional)
- âœ… Phase 5: Parentheses support for complex expressions (fully functional)
- âœ… LALRPOP Removal: Complete elimination of LALRPOP dependencies - WASM ready (fully completed)
- ðŸ“‹ WASM Deployment: Comprehensive strategy document created - 7-phase implementation plan (4.5 hours)
- ðŸ“‹ Future: Dyadic operator precedence when UI buttons are implemented

## User Preferences
- Prioritize minimal complexity over minimal code
- Value organizational simplicity and encapsulation
- Prefer comprehensive analysis documents before implementation
- Focus on maintaining existing functionality while adding capabilities

## Technical Decisions
- **Custom recursive descent parser**: Successful incremental implementation approach (current)
- **Precedence framework**: Method hierarchy supporting complex operator precedence
- **Phase-based development**: Minimal, testable increments with comprehensive strategies
- **Parallel parser architecture**: LALRPOP and Custom coexist with UI selection
- **Server-first deployment**: Primary strategy due to Cargo dependency resolution limitations
- **HTTP adapter pattern**: Preserves existing interfaces with automatic WASM fallback
- **Matrix formatting with `<pre>` tags**: Solves browser CSS inheritance issues
