# Matrix Formatting Bug Investigation

## Issue Description
The matrix alignment formatting changes were implemented but are not appearing in the web output. The matrices are still displaying with inconsistent alignment for single and double-digit numbers.

## Expected vs Actual Output

### Expected (after formatting changes):
```
> 4 4#~16
 0  1  2  3
 4  5  6  7
 8  9 10 11
12 13 14 15
```

### Actual (current output):
```
> 4 4#~16
0 1 2 3
4 5 6 7
8 9 10 11
12 13 14 15
```

## Investigation Findings

### 1. Code Change Status
- ✅ Modified `simple_server/src/j_array.rs` Display implementation
- ✅ Added proper width calculation for alignment
- ✅ Added right-alignment formatting with `{:>width$}`
- ✅ Server compiled and restarted successfully

### 2. Server Compilation
- ✅ No compilation errors related to the formatting changes
- ✅ Server running normally at http://0.0.0.0:5000
- ✅ Matrix operations working correctly (calculations are accurate)

### 3. Code Path Analysis
The formatting issue suggests the change may not be taking effect. Possible causes:

#### A. Caching/Build Issues
- The enhanced JArray Display implementation may not be fully rebuilt
- LALRPOP generated code might be caching old implementations

#### B. Code Path Verification
- Need to verify which Display implementation is actually being called
- The web server uses the LALRPOP pipeline: tokenizer → parser → semantic analyzer → evaluator
- Final output formatting happens through the JArray Display trait

#### C. Type System Investigation
- Original JArray used `Vec<i64>` and `rank` field
- Enhanced JArray uses `Vec<JValue>` and `ArrayShape`
- Backward compatibility layer may be interfering

### 4. Specific Areas to Investigate

#### Legacy Constructor Usage
```rust
// In evaluator.rs line 122:
Ok(JArray::vector(data))

// This calls the new constructor, should use new Display
```

#### Display Implementation Location
```rust
// In j_array.rs lines 352-398:
impl fmt::Display for JArray {
    fn fmt(&self, f: &mut fmt::Formatter<'_>) -> fmt::Result {
        match self.shape.rank() {
            // ... formatting code
        }
    }
}
```

#### Web Server Response Path
```rust
// In main.rs line 91:
format!("{}", result_array)

// This should call the Display trait
```

### 5. Potential Root Causes

#### Most Likely: Build Cache Issue
- The enhanced Display implementation exists but isn't being used
- Server restart may not have fully recompiled all dependencies
- LALRPOP build artifacts might be cached

#### Possible: Wrong Display Implementation
- Multiple Display implementations may exist
- Legacy JArray Display might still be active
- Import path issues in module structure

#### Less Likely: Type Mismatch
- JValue Display vs JArray Display confusion
- Matrix detection logic not triggering correctly

## Next Investigation Steps

1. **Verify Display Implementation**: Check if `self.shape.rank() == 2` branch is being reached
2. **Check Build Artifacts**: Examine if all code changes were properly compiled
3. **Test Matrix Detection**: Verify `is_matrix()` returns true for 2D arrays
4. **Trace Code Path**: Follow exact execution path from evaluator to web response

## Current Status
- ✅ Matrix calculations are mathematically correct
- ✅ Matrix structure is properly created (2D shape detected)
- ❌ Matrix formatting alignment is not applied
- ❌ Display improvements not visible in web output

The issue appears to be in the execution or compilation pipeline rather than the logic itself.
