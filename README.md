This project was a test to see what the current possibilities with Replit are for me.

A major way I interacted with the Replit agent was having it generate design documents and analysis documents, and providing feedback on them. It seems that making exhaustive or nearly exhaustive list of action items or steps helps the process. It's incredibly cluttered, but I didn't develop a more structured, lessy workflow. This hampered progress.

I feel like it would help to get the agent mind-mapping, showing the connections and dependencies of its process as a graph of dependencies, something like that. The visualizations are great for me as a means of condensing information. AI is really good at visualizations!

There is a huge amount of technical debt in this project. From an architectural point of view, the agent only ever added layers of stuff, never removed, never refined, never understood the peoject holistically. I think there's a lot of dead code.

I had a lot of fun doing this, and I hope you'll take in my tale with caution: the thing works, which is amazing, but the code is absolutely trash. I'm not happy with any of it. ðŸ¤·
